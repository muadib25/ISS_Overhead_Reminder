# ISS_Overhead_Reminder
A program that sends the recipient an email-reminder whenever the I.S.S. is passing over the sky.

## ABOUT
The [International Space Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station) is a modular space station (habitable artificial satellite) in low Earth orbit.

## REQUIREMENTS
Linux: Tested in Ununtu 20.04, but any modern Linux distro should do.
Windows: Tested in Windows 10.

If you are planning on running the program from source, make sure to install the tkinter python module.

## INSTALLATION
Extract the archive in a place on your hard disk. You can then simply navigate in the extracted directory and run the executable.

## USAGE
When the executable is run, a window pops up with a 'Start' and a 'Reset' button. When 'Start' is clicked, the timer counts down 25 mins (the Work period), followed by 5 mins (the Break period). This set of periods is then repeated 3 more times, the last Break being a 20 min resting period.

When each period ends the window pops up to front, followed by a system sound. When 'Reset' is pressed, the timer stops and resets.


Enjoy!
